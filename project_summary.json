"This AI-powered job tracking platform is a comprehensive React.js application that revolutionizes the job search experience. The system features an intelligent job feed with multi-dimensional filtering capabilities including role, skills, date, job type, work mode, location, and AI-generated match scores. At its core, the platform uses a sophisticated resume upload system that analyzes user qualifications and generates personalized job recommendations with color-coded compatibility scores (90%+ green, 70-89% yellow, below 70% red). The conversational AI assistant provides natural language search capabilities, allowing users to find jobs through intuitive queries while dynamically updating filter states in real-time. The application tracking system offers a visual timeline view with status updates (Applied, Under Review, Interview Scheduled, Offer Received, Rejected) and progress indicators. The platform implements user authentication with a personalized dashboard showing saved jobs, application history, and profile management. Built with modern technologies including React Router for navigation, Framer Motion for smooth animations, Context API for state management, and react-hook-form for form handling. The design emphasizes professional aesthetics with glassmorphism effects, gradient backgrounds, interactive hover states, and responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly across devices. Mock data systems simulate realistic job postings from various companies with detailed descriptions, requirements, and benefits. The UI features micro-interactions for filter updates, toast notifications for user feedback, and a floating chat interface for the AI assistant.\\n\\n**Last changes:** Created complete AI-powered job tracking platform with intelligent matching algorithm, conversational AI assistant, comprehensive filtering system, application tracker with timeline view, resume upload functionality, and modern professional UI with glassmorphism effects and smooth animations."
